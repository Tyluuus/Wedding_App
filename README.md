# Wedding App

## Motivation

App was created as substitute for wedding websites which are growing on popularity.

I decided to create solution containing all necessary information which guests may need.

## Description

App contains all parts that are also available in wedding websites:

* Date of event,
* Description about event,
* Counter to date of event,
* RSVP form,
* Information tab,
* Contact information,
* All location details.

As this application is created for mobile devices it contains solutions typical for mobiles:

* Adding event to calendar,
* Rerouting to map app for convenient navigation to proper location,
* Sending RSVP with SMS or e-mail.

## Languages / Frameworks

## Future development

There is plan to add handling push notifications when new information are added.
There is also architecture prepared for consume REST API but for now API is not created yet so
this should be next step.
